                <p>Finnwise, a small and unassuming villager from Evergrove, is dismissed by many as unimportant. However, his sharp wit, resourcefulness, and unwavering loyalty make him the true hero of the Etheral Realms.</p>
                <p>While Lioran carries the Emberstone, it is Finnwise’s cleverness that ensures its safe passage. In the final moments, as the group reaches the Pillar of Eternity, Finnwise performs a selfless act that activates the Emberstone, reigniting the Pillar and banishing the Shadowborn.</p>
                <p>Though his courage goes unnoticed by history, Finnwise’s story is a reminder that even the smallest among us can change the fate of the world.</p>
